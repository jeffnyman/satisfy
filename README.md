# Satisfy

Satisfy is an attempt to find a middle ground between my own [Specify](https://github.com/jnyman/specify) solution and my previous [Lucid](https://github.com/jnyman/lucid) solution. The latter was essentially a clone of Cucumber. The former relies entirely on RSpec. The goal of Satisfy is to satisfy (pun intended) my desire to explore a space between those two solutions.

## Installation

To get the latest stable release, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'satisfy'

To get the latest code:

```ruby
gem 'satisfy', git: https://github.com/jnyman/satisfy
```

After doing one of the above, execute the following command:

    $ bundle

You can also install Satisfy just as you would any other gem:

    $ gem install satisfy
